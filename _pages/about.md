# Literature Repository

Literature Repository is created for document management, storing statistical papers on statistics and machine learning. This repository contains two folders  "Papers by discussion date" and  " Papers by research areas"  

## Table of contents

- [Literature Repository](#literature-repository)
  - [Papers (By discussion date)](#papers-by-discussion-date)
  - [Papers(By research areas)](#papers-by-research-areas)

## Papers (By discussion date)

- Autumn Semester, 2022
- Spring Semester, 2023
